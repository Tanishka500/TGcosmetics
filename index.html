        <h3><p> 7 Body Lotion Benefits:</p>
            <p>Applying body lotion is one of the few inexpensive ways that people can pamper themselves. Bath body lotion seals moisture into the skin to prevent drying, while body care lotion softens rough elbows and heels, along with other dry areas of the skin. A quality body skin lotion can work wonders on scaly, dehydrated skin that feels rough and looks unattractive, and hand body lotion works especially well on the hands and feet, but can be applied all over the body. As millions of users will agree, body lotion provides many benefits to people who make time to use it on a regular basis.</p>
            <p>1. Re-hydrate dried skin.
            People who work in harsh climates often apply body lotion on a regular basis, perhaps even daily. Skin that is chapped or dried from wind, cold, or heat can be hard to treat with regular cosmetics. Some people have sensitive skin. No matter which type of climate they live in, their skin can become dry and irritated easily, sometimes even from indoor heat. Quality body lotion, applied after each shower or bath, can help to seal moisture deep in the skin to keep it hydrated and supple. It may not be a bad idea to keep a bottled of your favorite scented body lotion on hand for an after-bath application.</p>
            <p>2. Replenish extra dry or rough spots on the skin.
            Even if your normal skin type is oily or normal, you might have rough areas on your body, like around the elbows or knees that could benefit from skin lotion applications after a bath or at bedtime. With regular use, a replenishing lotion can ease rough skin and make it as smooth and silky as the rest of your body.</p>
            <p>3. Smooth calluses.
            If you are on your feet quite a bit you may have developed rough calluses that are painful and unsightly. A moist body lotion can make these areas supple and help you to remove the dead skin easier than if you attempted it without lotion. If your calluses appear discolored, swollen, or have red streaks running from them, check with your doctor rather than trying to remove them yourself.</p>
            <p>4. Feel and smell good.
            People love the feel of creamy lotion on their tired limbs or torso. Enjoy the relaxing sensation of lotion applied to your feet, legs, or arms. Specialty stores, department stores, and gift shops carry many different scents of body lotion to choose from. There are as many lotion types as you have moisturizing needs, so take advantage of the wealth of scents and textures to find one that suits your personality and needs.</p>
            <p>5. Help yourself relax.
            Even if your skin is in great shape and does not need to be moisturized with lotion, try a body massage with scented lotion on the hands. You can even get lotion that heats up during application to add sensory warmth to the parts of your body to which it is applied.
            The feel of gentle softness on your skin rotating in firm, steady massage movements can remove stress, subdue pain, and enhance endorphins to make you feel great. What a wonderful gift to present to someone who is feeling tired out and worn down!</p>
            <p>6. Soften the roughest parts of your body.
            Do your legs dry out after shaving? How about rough hands or toughened heels? No matter your age or lifestyle, body lotion can do wonders to help you relax and appreciate the simple comforts of life. You may want to keep a bottle of body lotion in the kitchen for your hands after doing dishes or in the bathroom after a quick wash-up. Put some in the spare bathroom for guests. Place a bottle of your favorite scented lotion in the bedroom to feel smooth and smell sweet at bedtime. There are dozens of uses for body lotion when you think about all the ways it can be applied to make your skin moist, supple, and sweet smelling.</p>
            <p>7. Make your skin glow.
            Now you can buy some kinds of lotion that add glimmer and shimmer to your skin tone. Brightening qualities are sometimes embedded in lotion to show up as tiny sparkling flecks on the skin when applied. Some cosmetic lotions can brighten the skin to remove dull, dead flakes and rejuvenate underlying tissues.
            Body care lotion serves a variety of purposes that benefit users in everyday life or for specific situations. Men and women in all walks of life, climates, and regions sometimes need skin hydration and moisturizing. As women get older and their skin becomes drier, body lotion can become a staple that helps to keep skin healthy and attractive. Romantic lotion users apply it with massage as a considerate gesture of affection. There are even medical lotions that treat certain skin conditions and problems, like metro gel for rosacea, or acne medication. Lotions can be used to kill head lice or heal skin sores. If you think about the various ways in which you used skin lotion over the past year, you may be surprised to find that it is more common that you might think. From skin care to health management and anti-aging treatments, body lotion serves a multitude of needs that we may overlook or take for granted.
            Body skin lotion can be purchased at most grocery or department stores. Generic brands may cost one dollar or so, with brand-name products running upwards of $100 if used for cosmetic appeal. Check the ingredients to make sure you are not allergic to any of them. Look for the names of chemicals that you know to have irritated your skin in the past. Also consider whether the lotion has preservatives, as some people find them irritating, which can cause their skin to break out, turn red, or otherwise react to the substance in the product.</p>
